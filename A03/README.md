#### Class
>A user define data type, which hold its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class

#### Object
>an instance of a class

#### Method
>a member function of a class

#### Abstraction
>displaying only essential information and hiding the details

#### Encapsulation
>combing data members and functions in a single unit called class

#### Polymorphism
>a call to a member function will casue a different function to be executed depending on the type of object that invokes the function

#### Overloading
>a type of polymorphism where operators are given different implementations depending on their arguments

#### Attributes / Properties
>allows extensions of metadata of an interace, class or sturct, method, parameter, or enumeration

#### Class Variable
>a variable created in a class of which a single copy exist

#### Instance Variable
>a variable defined in a class

#### Member Variable
>a variable defined outside a class

#### Inheritance
>the process of creating new classes from one exisiting class

#### Multiple Inheritance
>the process of creating new classes from more than one existing class

#### Composition
>the principle that classes should achieve polymorphic behavior
